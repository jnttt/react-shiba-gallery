Welcome to the Shiba Inu Gallery README
This is a gallery of images of Shiba Inus generated from "http://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=100"
Inspired by our family dog who was also a Shiba Inu.

Used Visual Studio Code
HTML, CSS, ReactJS

Stretch goals I have for this project are to add a functionality where clicking an image enlarges it and you can click through the gallery one by one. Maybe add a carousel.
